% errorPrediction

To be able to predict variance of rw I needed covariance. Here I tried to extract it from Gibbs distribution.
Does not really work


% errorPrediction2,3

I use different formullas form the book and it works


% errorPrediction4

I count variance using my version of formula (6.21) for discrete case 
and also if I skip values
