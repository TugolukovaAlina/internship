%dependencyJustSkipping
RGG(200, 0.13) 
just skipping some node without increasing length of random walk does not improve estimates

%dependencySkipSameSampleSize
if the sample size is the same, it is better if the samples are not neighbors. the more separated the better

%dependencyJustMoreSamples
of corse the mmore samples the better
